            The interaction of households with energy is becoming more complex,
            driven by smart devices, time of use charges from utilities, home
            storage batteries, solar panels, solar hot water, vehicle-to-grid or
            vehicle-to-house technology, and potentially others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Managing and optimizing this energy flow for cost effectiveness,
            reliability, and comfort is a computational task too difficult (and
            uninteresting to most people) to be done manually.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="card">
          The system (generally a residence) energy inputs and outputs can be
          thought of as a kind of “energy economy” in which energy is bought
          from the grid or produced at home and used or sold to various
          “buyers”, either household functions or an external utility. Decisions
          about sourcing, storing, using, and selling energy require a system
          model as well as predictive capabilities. In the case of a residence,
          energy usually comes in the form of electricity or heat. Systems for
          energy management already exist for large commercial buildings, we
          believe that technology has advanced sufficiently to make them
          cost-effective for homes.

        <h2>Our Focus</h2>
        <p class="card">
          The initial focus for JouleBox is the definition of strategies and
          methods for achieving optimal system (home) energy performance
          including potential data sources such as sensors, and internet
          accessible data (e.g. weather forecasts). Initial outputs will be
          limited to reporting of potential actions and perhaps simple on/off
          control for some devices. Longer term, it is anticipated that energy
          industry manufacturers would want to implement strategies identified
          here in products made available to homeowners and/or utilities.
        </p>
        <p class="card">
            We believe that this should be of interest both to
            homeowners/consumers wishing to save money while retaining comfort
            as well as utilities wishing to make more optimal use of their
            assets while reducing capital outlays for infrastructure and
            accelerating the transition to sustainable WWS (Wind/Water/Solar)
            energy.
