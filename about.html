        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            We have been inspired by the idea of providing a cost effective,
            intuitive, and easy to use interface for energy management within
            a residence. We are well aware of the limits for current home
            energy management systems including <span class="highlight">lack of common interfaces</span> and
            limited device availability. We believe that electric vehicles and
            home power storage devices will proliferate and offer a potential
            for greatly reducing peak demand from the electric grid - <span class="highlight">but this needs to be properly managed
            </span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team wants to partner with others with shared goals.

          <h2>Bruce Sawhill - Inspiration</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Bruce Sawhill is a Stanford-educated physicist and mathematician with a keen interest in sustainable energy. His recent work is in the area of algorithm development for complex logistics challenges, from aviation to electric power.  Bruce believes that the transition to a society powered by renewables will be long and expensive, but that it is well within the capabilities of current technologies. He co-founded JouleBox for the purpose of attaining quick and inexpensive wins that accelerate the transition to renewables.
